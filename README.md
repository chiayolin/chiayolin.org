chiayolin.org is my personal website which I have been running since 2014.

The site is built with React.js, statically generated using Next.js, and
currently deployed to Vercel.

## Running Locally

To run the site locally, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.

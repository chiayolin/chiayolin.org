A book would not become famous just because it is written in a popular
language. At the end of the day, ideas behind the words are what matter
the most. The same concept applies to programming languages, too. A good
programming language should be able to describe the abstract beings that
inhabit a man's mind simply. By conjuring the recursive combinations made
of simple primitives, Lisp simplifies even the most complicated computational
processes that inhabit a human's brain. Just like how Bob Dylan's poems
simplify the most complex and obscure human emotion.
